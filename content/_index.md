This website contains practical and distilled knowledge for every day use. Acquired from exploration of software tooling and computer science topics. I plan to post content on a broad range of topics such as: Linux configuration, Shell scripting, Data Structures and Algorithms, Networking, Cybersecurity, CLI tools, Programming languages (C#, Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Perl, Bash), and other cool projects and services.
